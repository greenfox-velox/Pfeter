# Create a class called "Car"
# It should have a "type" property that stores the car's type in a string eg: "Mazda"
# It should have a "km" property that stores how many kilometers it have run
# The km and the type property should be a parmeter in the constructor
# It should have a method called "run" that takes a number and increments the "km" property by it
